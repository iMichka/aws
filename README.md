# p-linnanes's Mastodon Infrastructure

Terraform infrastructure and code to run my own Mastodon instance.

Mastodon is a free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services: <https://joinmastodon.org/en>.

This code was generously provided by @iMichka. You can follow him on Mastodon at <http://mastodon.imichka.me>.
