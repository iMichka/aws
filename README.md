# p-linnane's Mastodon Infrastructure

This repo contains the infrastructure and the code to run my own Mastodon instance.

Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services: <https://joinmastodon.org/en>.

This code has been generously provided by @iMichka. You can follow him on Mastodon at <http://mastodon.imichka.me>.
